	<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>The FUNBOX is an experience different from anything else on Planet Earth. After Alien AI sent an enormous cube shaped drone towards Earth, it misses its target of the city of San Mercedes, and finds its new home atop the Funland Theme Park in the middle of celebrating their 100th anniversary. This leads to the disappearance of over a few thousand guests and team	members.</p>
		<p> Despite human attempts of rescue, years go by with nothing but deafening silence from inside. Many years after all hope is gone, giant numbers appear on the front of the cube, counting down 365 days. Over the next year, this AI species uses advertising platforms to announce THE FUNBOX, always matching the countdown. When the numbers hits zero, they glitch and change to “WELCOME TO THE FUNBOX”. A door appears and slowly opens, revealing an Al generated theme park built on top of the remains of Funland. This park immediately grabbed the attention of past Funland fans and became a huge success.</p>
	
	<h2>Funland Themepark</h2>
		<p>After opening to a local audience just before the turn of the century. Funland Theme Park quickly grew into a tourist staple of Southern California culture. It spent the first 50 years as a
typical midway with classic attractions such as a train and wooden roller coaster. In the 1950's, following the success of other theme parks, it expanded its gates and opened five new themed
lands, including a brand-new Main Street for shopping and dining. As they approached their 100th anniversary, they continued to draw crowds and opened a variety of new and exciting
			attractions.</p>
		
		<h2>The Box</h2>
		<p>A type 4 alien civilization created giant cube shaped black drones to colonize the perfect planet. These impenetrable cubes have a hollow inside that is meant to enclose whatever surface they
land upon. The cube’s Al will then use the source, offen a city-type environment, to generate and build upon the land in new ways that could accommodate their species while also using the resources of the host planet.</p>
	
		<h2>The Invasion</h2>
		<p>On September 10, 1998, only 31 days into Funland's 100th anniversary celebration, the
smallest of the black cubes crashed into the Octo-spin attraction, killing an unknown number of
guests and employees. Immediately following, more cubes of varying sizes came down,
crushing different buildings and attractions throughout the park. As people begin to evacuate
and find shelter, an enormous shadow looms over the park, and the largest cube slowly
descends, trapping the remainder of the people inside. No sound can be heard from outside the
			box for 25 years.</p>
		
		<h2>Dimensional Anomolies</h2>
		<p>The site of Funland has seen strange happenings throughout its entire existence, which seem to
become more severe as time goes on. Many people have trouble taking photos in or around
Funland, and some even claim to have met their doubles wandering the park. Some people
report seeing guests wearing "strange clothing" and asking about non-existent attractions. To
this day, many fans have taken note of these oddities and anomalies and have been gathering
vintage photos of the park to better piece together these occurrences. Now that The FUNBOX is
open, all guests are encouraged to wear a complimentary pair of Hypno-Goggles or the mood
altering Hypno-Helmet. Walking around The FUNBOX without one or both accessories can lead
to headaches, dizziness, hallucinations, and even mania or madness. Park security and The
			FUNBOX Al are determined to keep Guests away from areas where these effects are stronger.</p>
